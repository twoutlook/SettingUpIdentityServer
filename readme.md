# Setting up Identity Server

This code accompanies the videos that are hosted in IdentityServer.com that talk about setting up Identity Server. 
There are three parts to this, a base installation of Identity Server that uses in-memory stores, taking that version of Identity Server and extending it to use EntityFramework store, and finally adding ASP.Net Identity to manage users

The code also contains two clients, an API client and an MVC client that calls the API client
